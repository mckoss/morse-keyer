# morse-keyer

A web-interface for a Morse Code keyer.  The plan is to implement
all the features of the [Curtis Keyer](http://www.arrl.org/news/curtis-keyer-chip-developer-jack-curtis-k6ku-sk)
as well as some other experimental options.  See the [extensive product manual](./docs/CK-8045ABM.pdf)
for more information.

Brad Mitchell's [History of Curtis Keyers](./docs/curtis-qst-aug-2016.png) appeared in the August 2016 edition of QST magazine.  He also posted this
YouTube video about it here:

The interface is using the keyboard (or virtual keyboard) right and left
control keys.  See the [Ham Radio Solutions USB interface](https://hamradio.solutions/vband/) to use a
key or paddle to emulate a keyboard (click on the Store tab).
